# Disclaimer
- I am not responsible for the misuse of the tool.
- Google Search has mechanisms to prevent abusive use or detection of suspicious activity. If at any time the tool does not show results, Google has temporarily blocked you (e.g. Captcha).
- All the information obtained is public and through Google results. 
- Logically, the searches are in Google, so it leaves no evidence in the logs of the target's server.
- And very important, if you see a file, directory, subdomain, etcetera... Indexed in Google, does not mean that it still exists on the server (or it does ;)).
